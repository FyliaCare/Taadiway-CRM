### Run this SQL:

-- Replace 'your@email.com' with your actual email
UPDATE "User" 
SET 
  "role" = 'SUPER_ADMIN', 
  "isSuperAdmin" = true
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';

-- Verify the update
SELECT id, email, name, role, "isSuperAdmin" 
FROM "User" 
WHERE email = 'your@email.com';
```

## Troubleshooting

**"Email already registered"**
- The email is already in the database
- Use a different email or sign in instead

**"Password too short"**
- Password must be at least 6 characters
- Use a stronger password

**"Failed to create account"**
- Check Render logs for errors
- Verify database connection is working
- Check `/api/health` endpoint

**Your CRM now has full authentication! ðŸŽ‰**
